# VivaJour Privacy Policy
Last Updated: March 2025

VivaJour (“the App”), developed by VivaJour Labs, helps users create travel albums and stories from their photos. We prioritize user privacy and data protection.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection
VivaJour does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All photo processing, album creation, and metadata extraction occur entirely on your device.

## 2. Photos and Media
The App only accesses photos and media that you manually select.  
We do not:
- Upload photos automatically  
- Store photos on external servers  
- Share photos with any third parties  

EXIF metadata (date, location, camera info) is processed only on-device to help organize albums and is never transmitted.

## 3. Optional Sharing
If you choose to share an album, VivaJour temporarily uploads user-selected images and layout data to generate a shareable link.

This action is fully user-initiated and optional.
VivaJour does not associate shared content with user accounts, does not collect personal identifiers, and does not use shared content for analytics, tracking, or advertising.

Shared content is delivered over encrypted HTTPS connections and is used solely to fulfill the user’s explicit sharing request.

## 4. Local Storage
Albums, preferences, and journaling notes remain on your device. Deleting the App removes all locally stored data.

## 5. Internet Use
The App may access the internet to load map tiles or upload user-initiated shared albums.  
We do not track or log any user behavior.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed at children under 13 but collects no data from any user.

## 7. Contact
